# Sales
This repository contains my analysis of the Walmart Sales available on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset)
*** Data Preprocessing.ipynb is where I did my data preprocessing which included: 
1. data cleaning :filling the missing values 
2. Data integration: combined different datasets into a single dataset.
3. Data transformation: checked for skewness and outliers. Scaled and normalized the data.
4. Feature engineering : Selected the best features for model development.

*** Model.ipynb will contain the code for model development.

*** There will be a power BI file that will contain the visualizations of the data.


***** I used the following Python libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Scikit learn
I used Power BI for visualiztions
